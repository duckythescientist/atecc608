# ATECC608B Microchip CryptoAuthentication Device

Work in progress code to parse (and create and write???) the configuration of ATECC608 chips. The full datasheet is behind NDA, but there are partial datasheets and a lot of code available.


## Part Numbers

The Trust&Go parts (TNG) are preconfigured and locked. These can be purchased in quantity 10 from Microchip.

The Flex (FLX) parts are preconfigured and locked but have more flexibilty in data configuration. This can be sampled purchased in quantity 10 and can be purchased preconfigured in quantity 2k from Microchip.

The raw chips (MAH/SSH) are unconfigured and need to be configured before use. This process is locked under NDA. They can be purchased in quantity 1 from Digikey et al.


## Documentation

The full datasheet is under NDA, but I found a preliminary datasheet at https://news.bit2me.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ATECC608A-chip-ColdCard.pdf
